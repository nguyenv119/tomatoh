“what’d you just accomplish?” — stay real with your productivity

**note: not on the Chrome Web Store — the $5 publishing fee is better spent on a pepperoni slice at Joe’s.**

---

### 🧠 Why?

most of us *feel* productive, but it’s hard to recall what we actually accomplished.
every few minutes (you set the interval), tomatoh gently asks:  
> “what did you just accomplish?”

by logging small moments of focus — or lack thereof — you start building honest accountability. you’ll see patterns and actually stay on track with clarity instead of drifting.
This helped me **A TON** during my internship!
